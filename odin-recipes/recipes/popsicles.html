        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken noodle soupsicles are popsicles made from chicken noodle soup.
            They are a close relative of spaghettio popsicles. 
            If you desire to make those, simply substitute spaghettios for chicken noodle soup.  
            They were created by Reddit user u/iplay2keep and posted on r/shittyfoodporn.

            These delicious popsicles make a bold statement about the suffering of others.
            Chicken noodle soup, a symbol of warmth and healing, is violated against its control and 
            frozen, denying it its purpose in existence and leading it to be hated.
            However, humanity seems to find its despair tasty and humorous.
