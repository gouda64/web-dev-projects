        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            None pizza with left beef is an internet classic consisting of a pizza with nothing but beef chunks on the left side.
            It was originally conceived by Steve Molaro on his blog The Sneeze to test Domino's left-right orientation correctness.

            This attractive pizza speaks to the true nature of the world by laying bare its doughy interior.
            The beef symbolizes the decadence than can come from simplicity, 
            or perhaps simply the value of the balance between prosperity and humbleness.
            We have much to learn from this delicious work of art.
            Plato would be proud.
