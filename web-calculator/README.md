As a note, the scaling might be a bit off depending on your browser.

FYI, the clear button (C) also clears the current operation. Also, there might be some precision issues with big numbers.

Also, there's keyboard functionality now. Everything is pretty much as you would expect. For clear, press "c" and for +/- press "p".
